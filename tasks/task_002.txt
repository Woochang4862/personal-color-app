# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Environment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up environment variable management for secure API key handling and configuration settings.
# Details:
1. Create `.env.example` and `.env` files for environment variables
2. Add OpenAI API key configuration:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
   ```
3. Implement a configuration service in `/src/services/config.js`:
   ```javascript
   export const config = {
     openai: {
       apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
       apiUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_URL,
     },
     // Add other configuration settings as needed
   };
   
   // Validate configuration
   export const validateConfig = () => {
     if (!config.openai.apiKey) {
       console.error('OpenAI API key is missing');
       return false;
     }
     return true;
   };
   ```
4. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent API key exposure
5. Create a README.md with setup instructions for environment variables
6. Implement configuration validation on application startup

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that environment variables are correctly loaded
2. Test configuration validation function with missing API key
3. Ensure API key is not exposed in client-side bundle
4. Confirm that configuration service correctly provides values to other parts of the application

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define environment variables [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and list all required environment variables for the project
### Details:
Review the project requirements, database connections, API keys, and other configuration needs. Create a comprehensive list of all environment variables needed across different environments.

## 2. Implement secure storage for sensitive data [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up a secure method to store and manage sensitive environment variables
### Details:
Research and implement a secure vault or secret management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store sensitive information like API keys and database passwords.

## 3. Configure environment-specific setups [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Set up environment variables for development, staging, and production environments
### Details:
Create separate configuration files or use environment-specific tools to manage variables for each environment (development, staging, production). Ensure that sensitive data is not hardcoded and is securely fetched from the storage implemented in subtask 2.

## 4. Implement access controls and monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Set up access controls and monitoring for environment variables
### Details:
Implement role-based access controls for managing environment variables. Set up monitoring and alerting for any unauthorized access attempts or changes to critical environment variables.
